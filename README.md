# Flood-Forecast
 Model of Flood Forecast applying Random Forest and Markov Chain with use of LIDAR data 
By utilizing data such as weather records, land use and land cover (LULC) information, topo-graphic LiDAR data, and advanced predictive models, the study aims to identify the most vul-nerable areas and provide recommendations for risk mitigation. The results indicate that inte-grating these technologies can improve forecasting accuracy, thereby supporting more informed decisions in land management.
